                    <h2>About Seattle</h2>
                    <p>
                        Seattle is a city in Washington founded in 1851. It is the 18th 
                        most populous city in the U.S, and the most populous in Washington 
                        with a population over 780,000. It's known for its prominence in
                        performing arts as well as being the home of grunge music. Some
                        major attractions in the city include the 
                        <a href="#space-needle">Space Needle</a>, 
                        <a href="#pike-place">Pike Place Market</a>, 
                        <a href="#boat-ride">the boat rides</a>, and much more.

                    <h2>My Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        I visited Seattle back in 2022 for my 18th birthday. At the time,
                        it had been a while since I had gone out of state for anything, so
                        I was really looking forward to visiting Seattle to gain new 
                        experiences. One of the main things that drew me towards Seattle
                        out of all places was the Space Needle, and the view that you
                        get while up there. While visiting, however, I discovered that 
                        there was much more to the city that I wasn't even aware about, 
                        and found my self enjoying the trip even more than I thought I
                        would.

                            As I said before, this is what compelled me to go to Seattle.
                            I really wanted to see the skyline from the top of this thing, 
                            and I definitely wasn't disappointed when I got there. I went 
                            up nearing sunset, so I got to see the view of the city in the
                            daylight and at night. One thing that shocked me about the Space
                            Needle was the rotating glass floor. I had no idea that this was
                            a thing before getting there, but it was pretty cool being able to
                            look straight down from the top. Since the floor was rotating, you 
                            could also just stand in one spot and get a constantly changing
                            view.

                        <p>
                            One thing that I haven't mentioned yet is that I am somewhat
                            afraid of heights. I was obviously aware of this before going
                            up the Space Needle, and was willing to push through it to see
                            the view. At first it was pretty scary, especially on the 
                            elevator ride up and when I first saw the glass floor. After
                            being up there for a bit and walking around on the glass
                            floor, I got used to it. What I didn't get used to, however,
                            was the outside area. The constant wind and cold air while 
                            outside only reminded me of how high up I was. Along with that
                            the slanted glass panes allowed you to lean a bit over the edge
                            to see the shear drop. Even though I was terrified, I still
                            managed to lean on the slanted glass for a few seconds.
                        </p>

                            After conquering my fear of heights the day prior, visiting
                            the Pike Place Market was a big and much needed change of
                            speed in my visit to Seattle. Seeing all the underground
                            shops and what they had to offer was really cool, and it
                            felt like it was never ending. After exploring all the shops, 
                            we went to see the infamous gum wall. Although pretty disgusting,
                            I think it's pretty cool to get a visual of just how many people
                            have been there through pieces of gum on a wall. Right after 
                            seeing the gum wall, we decided to get a nice cup of coffee
                            at the Ghost Alley Espresso coffee shop right next to the wall. 
                            Overall, walking through the market was a fun and chill experience 
                            that I would reccomend to anybody.

                            On our last day, we decided it would be nice to take a chill 
                            ride on a tour boat around the bay. I feel like this was the perfect
                            thing to do as the trip came to a close because I got to see the
                            city in its entirety from the outside with a nice tour guide 
                            talking about everything that we got to see. It was an hour long 
                            excursion with nice music, food, drinks, and a good
                            tour guide.
