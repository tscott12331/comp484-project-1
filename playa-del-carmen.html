                    <h2>About Playa del Carmen</h2>
                    <p>
                        Playa del Carmen is a city in the state of Quintana Roo, 
                        Mexico. It is home to over 300,000 people and is growing 
                        quite fast with an annual rate at 7.5%. The city is a popular
                        tourist spot due to the beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and 
                        the rainforest surrounding the area.

                    <h2>My Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's been just over a year since I visited Playa del Carmen 
                        back in August 2024. At the start of 2024, I had no idea that
                        I would be going on this trip. It really turned out to be a 
                        last minute trip that I agreed to go on with some family. That 
                        being said, I was really lucky that the family members I went 
                        with had been planning for some time, and had an itinerary full 
                        of activities to do. I was also lucky that some of my family 
                        members had done this before, so they were already familiar with 
                        how to get around. I had never gone on a full trip to Mexico before, 
                        so this was definitely comforting. They wanted to go to Playa 
                        del Carmen instead of the nearby Cancun because of the city's 
                        proximity to a bunch of cool outdoor activities that I'll talk 
                        about more later.

                        <p>
                            As I mentioned before, I decided to go on this trip last 
                            minute. Because of this, I pretty much had zero knowledge 
                            about any of the activities we were doing, including this 
                            one. XCaret is a popular theme/water park in Mexico that 
                            provides a wide variety of attractions. While there, we 
                            swam through underground rivers, walked through a nice 
                            butterfly garden, ate at a buffet on the beach, and ended 
                            the day by watching a performance in the park's theater. 
                            It was honestly an amazing experience that I would love to 
                            do again if given the chance, especially since we really 
                            couldn't get to everything due to time.

                            This excursion is one that wasn't actually planned by 
                            anybody intitially. After visiting a couple cenotes, my 
                            little cousin really wanted to see more. We had been 
                            seeing a bunch of tour busses take off that said "Xenotes," 
                            so we looked into it and decided to give it a try. We 
                            definitely were not disappointed.
                        </p>

                            class="article-img"
                        />
                        <p>
                            During the tour, we visited four different cenotes. At one 
                            of them, we swam around an open cenote with goggles on to 
                            look at the fish and structure of the cenote beneath the 
                            surface of the water. At another, we ziplined across the 
                            cenote before eventually jumping in. At the third one, we 
                            kayaked around another long semi-open cenote. Finally, at the
                            last one we rappelled down a pretty deep cenote and chilled in 
                            the cold water down there for a while. The whole experience of 
                            all this was really cool, and we had a good tour guide that 
                            talked about and explained the different types of cenotes that 
                            we visited.

                            Visiting these ruins was one of the coolest parts of our 
                            trip. Although it was really hot and humid, the beauty of 
                            the structures was enough for me to love it. I had never seen 
                            any sort of ruins before, so getting to see Chichen Itza 
                            was a new and surreal experience, and it made me understand 
                            why it's one of the seven wonders of the world. Learning 
                            about the architecture and some of it's design choices 
                            was really fascinating, especially the fact that the pyramid 
                            produces an echo that sounds like a quetzal at the clap of the 
                            hand. Another really cool part was seeing the structure for 
                            the Mayan Ball Game. While the rules of the game are not entirely 
                            known, it was still really interesting to see and learn about.
