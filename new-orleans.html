                    <h2>About New Orleans</h2>
                    <p>
                        Founded in 1718 under French colonial rule, New Orleans has a rich
                        history and culture. 37 years after being obtained by the U.S in 
                        the Louisiana Purchase, New Orleans was the third most populous city
                        in the country. Although the city no longer holds that position, it
                        still holds over 380,000 people. From it's jazzy tunes to the 
                        delicious Creole food, the city has a lot to offer.

                    <h2>My Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        I went to New Orleans in July 2022 as a summer family trip. Going 
                        into the trip, I really didn't know much about the city and was just
                        tagging along with the family. During the trip, however, I found 
                        myself pleasantly surprised with all the things you can do in 
                        the city. Three of the favorite things that I did while on the trip
                        were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                        <h3>Airboats</h3>

                        <p>
                            When I landed in New orleans, one of the last things that I
                            thought I'd be doing was zooming on an airboat. So when my
                            family decided that they wanted to go a little out of the way 
                            to do this, I really didn't know what to expect. When we got 
                            to the spot though, I knew it was going to be a good time. Not
                            only did we drift around a swamp in an airboat going really 
                            fast, we also got to see a bunch of gators just swimming around. 
                            This part of the trip was probably the most unexpected, but also
                            the most thrilling and adrenaline pumping.

                            French Quarter is a classic tourist location when visiting
                            New Orleans, so we had to visit it. One of the main spots we 
                            went to was Bourbon Street. This was one of the most active 
                            places that I've ever been to. It was filled with people front 
                            to back with jazz playing all around. We also walked around 
                            quite a bit just to site see in the quarter. We saw the 
                            St. Louis Cathedral, explored the French Market, and got 
                            coffee and Cafe Du Monde.

                            Another excursion that I wasn't expecting to do on this trip
                            was a ghost tour. I had no idea about the paranormal history 
                            and legends within the city, so it was pretty interesting to 
                            learn about it. While on the tour, we walked around different 
                            parts of the city while the tour guide talked about various
                            legends and ghost stories. He showed us a bunch of supposed 
                            haunted spots, and the history behind them. Even though I'm 
                            not really a believer in ghosts, I still think it was a fun 
                            and interesting experience to have, and I definitely learned 
                            a good amount of history while on this tour.
