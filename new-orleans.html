                <h2>About New Orleans</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 1718 under French colonial rule, New Orleans has a rich
                    history and culture. 37 years after being obtained by the U.S in 
                    the Louisiana Purchase, New Orleans was the third most populous city
                    in the country. Although the city no longer holds that position, it
                    still holds over 380,000 people. From it's jazzy tunes to the 
                    delicious Creole food, the city has a lot to offer.

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I went to New Orleans in July 2022 as a summer family trip. Going 
                    into the trip, I really didn't know much about the city and was just
                    tagging along with the family. During the trip, however, I found 
                    myself pleasantly surprised with all the things you can do in 
                    the city. Three of the favorite things that I did while on the trip
                    were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    <h3>Airboats</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I landed in New orleans, one of the last things that I
                        thought I'd be doing was zooming on an airboat. So when my
                        family decided that they wanted to go a little out of the way 
                        to do this, I really didn't know what to expect. When we got 
                        to the spot though, I knew it was going to be a good time. Not
                        only did we drift around a swamp in an airboat going really 
                        fast, we also got to see a bunch of gators just swimming around. 
                        This part of the trip was probably the most unexpected, but also
                        the most thrilling and adrenaline pumping.

                    <h3>French Quarter</h3>
                    <p>
                        French Quarter is a classic tourist location when visiting
                        New Orleans, so we had to visit it. One of the main spots we 
                        went to was Bourbon Street. This was one of the most active 
                        places that I've ever been to. It was filled with people front 
                        to back with jazz playing all around. We also walked around 
                        quite a bit just to site see in the quarter. We saw the 
                        St. Louis Cathedral, explored the French Market, and got 
                        coffee and Cafe Du Monde.
